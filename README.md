My Conway's Game of Life project  
***Not optimized yet***  
This is just a little side project to work on my optimization skills and mess around with different patterns in Conway's Game of Life.

## A little bit about the game  
If you have never heard of the "Game of Life", developed by John Conway in the
early 70's I suggest that you check out the wikepedia page listed here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life. It is a fun little game that replicates cell automation. Below I will list some fun patterns to get you started.

**To run**  
Step 1 : Download Repository  
Step 2 : Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder you downloaded  
Step 3 : Enter the following commands:

> javac Main.java

Step 4 : *Have fun using my Conway's Game of Life Program!!!*
